      "question": "What happens when a method is assigned to a variable and called directly in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "It maintains its original context",
        "It loses its context (this)",
        "It creates a new context",
        "It throws an error"
      ],
      "correctAnswers": ["It loses its context (this)"],
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "When a method is assigned to a variable and called directly, it loses its context (this). In non-strict mode, this will be undefined."

      "question": "Which of the following are true about Promises in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "They can be chained using .then()",
        "They can handle asynchronous operations",
        "They can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswers": ["All of the above"],
      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They can be chained, handle async operations, and have three possible states."

    {
      "id": "js-medium-3",
      "question": "What is the difference between let and const?",
      "options": [
        "let can be reassigned, const cannot",
        "const must be initialized when declared",
        "let is block-scoped, const is function-scoped",
        "const creates immutable values"
      ],
      "correctAnswers": [
        "let can be reassigned, const cannot",
        "const must be initialized when declared"
      ],
      "type": "multiple",
      "explanation": "let and const are both block-scoped, but const cannot be reassigned and must be initialized when declared. const does not make values immutable, it only prevents reassignment of the variable."

    {
      "id": "js-medium-4",
      "question": "What happens when you use map() followed by filter() on an array?",
      "options": [
        "It transforms each element and then filters the results",
        "It filters first and then transforms",
        "It only transforms the elements",
        "It only filters the elements"
      ],
      "correctAnswers": ["It transforms each element and then filters the results"],
      "type": "single",
      "explanation": "When chaining map() and filter(), map() first transforms each element in the array, and then filter() processes the transformed array to keep only elements that match the filter condition."
